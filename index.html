            <h2>Why You Should Get Eyelash Extensions</h2><br>
            <p>
              Eyelash extensions will give you longer, thicker and very natural looking eyelashes. They look so natural
              no one will know they are not yours! Eyelash extensions are worn by famous celebrities like Nicole Kidman,
              Star Jones, Paris Hilton, Kim Kardashian, Lindsay Lohan, Gwen Stefani, Lucy Liu, Naomi Campbell and Liz
              Hurley
              to name a few. But you don't have to be a celebrity to wear them. Women everywhere are catching on and
              becoming Lash Addicted!<br><br>

              LASH OUT! eyelash extension professionals specialize in this revolutionary new service that will extend your
              natural eyelashes and draw attention to your eyes. Extensions are perfect for everyday wear as well as
              special
              occasions. They are semi-permanent and made from synthetic fibers. Each lash is applied one by one to your
              own natural lashes. With proper care and touchup visits they can last a very long time. Normally a person's
              natural eyelash falls out every 60 - 90 days and a new lash grows in immediately. Therefore, it is necessary
              to
              get touch-ups to fill in the fallen lashes. About every 2 to 3 weeks is recommended, however, this will vary
              from
              person to person. Your natural lash cycle as well as how you take care of your lashes will affect how long
              they
              last. Some LASH OUT! clients have had their extensions for over a year with regular touchups visits.<br><br>

              The extensions are single strands of synthetic eyelashes that are curved to replicate a natural eyelash.
              They
              provide length and thickness to your own lashes and are available in varying lengths and thickness. They are
              applied to your individual eyelashes, one lash at a time. There is no need for mascara even though a water
              based mascara is fine to use. The result is thicker, longer, eye opening eyelashes that are safe in the
              shower,
              while swimming, sleeping or exercising.<br><br>

              Eyelash extensions are great for everyday wear or special occasions. Eyelash extensions brighten and open
              your eyes. Eyelash extensions have gained a tremendous amount of popularity in the last couple of years
              because the look achieved is so natural. Whether you are looking for an everyday look, lashes for your
              wedding
              day or just a weekend away LASH OUT! professionals have a perfected technique that will transform your look
              to WOW!

            <h2>Health Concerns</h2><br>
            <p><b>What should you do before your Eyelash Extension appointment?</b><br>
              Inform your eyelash extension professional any information on adhesive allergies when making the
              appointment.
              Any type of allergy to band aids, glues, stickers, and/or rubber can cause a reaction. Your extensionist can
              perform a patch test on your skin to check for a possible allergy to the adhesive. The patch test will take
              about 15
              minutes so let the person taking the appointment know that you have concerns about an allergic reaction.
              Remove any eye make-up, including mascara. Cleanse your eyelids & lashes thoroughly.
              The entire eye area should be cosmetic-free so that the stylist can get an unobstructed view of your natural
              lashes. Most eyelash extensionist will then cleanse the eye with a special cleanser to remove proteins and
              oil
              residue. A clean surface is vital in creating a strong bond.
              Remove contact lenses before application.

              <strong>What should you do After your Eyelash Extension appointment?</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Do not perm or tint lashes after lash extension application.</li>
                <li>Do not use a regular eyelash curler to curl Extensions (you won't need to curl your extensions).</li>
                <li>Do not rub your eyes or lashes when washing your face. Clean around the eyes with a wash cloth.</li>
                <li>Do not pull your lash extensions, as it will take out your own lash as well!</li>
                <li>Do not go in a Sauna while wearing Eyelash Extensions for at least for 48hrs. Do not get them wet at
                  all for 24hrs.</li>
                <li>If you choose to wear mascara - only apply to the tips and use water-based mascara that washes off
                  easily.</li>
                <li>Do not try to remove the Extensions on your own, call me and I will remove them without harming your
                  natural lashes.</li>
                <li>Do not cut the Extensions (you may cut your own lashes).</li>
                <li>Clean your eye make-up, but be gentle with your Extensions.</li>
                <li>Remember to come in for touch ups (2-4 weeks).</li>
                <li>Never tug, twist, pick or pull at your lashes or extensions.</li>
                <li>Treat your eyes gently - as if you have makeup on that you don't want to smudge.</li>
                <li>Brush and groom your lashes gently with a disposable mascara spoolie or eye shadow brush (best
                  choice).</li>
                <li>Try to sleep on your back or side, avoid smashing your lashes completely as you sleep.</li>
                <li>When using night creams/serums, apply sparingly and blot off excess.</li>
                <li>When you touch your lashes, always use upward, sweeping motions - no side to side rubbing at the lash
                  line.</li>
                <li>Keep your fingers off your lashes. Every time you touch them you are transferring natural oil and
                  germs.</li>
              </ul>

              <b>REVITALASH® ADVANCED</b><br>
              <em>Eyelash Conditioner</em><br><br>
              Original, one-of-a-kind, Ophthalmologist developed lash conditioner that enhances the look of lashes and
              protects against breakage, while improving health, flexibility and strength, for lashes that thrive,
              naturally.<br><br>
              <b>Features and benefits:</b><br>
              <ul>
                <li>Conditions the eyelashes to help protect from brittleness and breakage.</li>
                <li>Helps improve flexibility, moisture and shine.</li>
                <li>Helps defend eyelashes from daily aggressors.</li>
                <li>Enhances the appearance of beautiful, younger-looking, more luxurious eyelashes.</li>
                <li>High impact BioPeptin Complex™, peptides and botanicals saturate the lashes with moisture, keeping
                  them soft, luxurious and healthy-looking.</li>
              </ul>
              <b><br>In a study:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>98% of users reported improved lash appearance.</li>
                <li>98% of users reported healthier-looking lashes.</li>
                <li>98% of users reported stronger lashes.</li><br>
              </ul>
              How to use: Wash hands and face with a mild soap and water. Let face and eye area dry completely prior to
              application. Once a day, apply a thin line to clean and dry eyelashes above the level of the skin. One brush
              stroke is sufficient to cover eyelashes. Only a small quantity is needed to beautify and promote the
              attractiveness of natural lashes. For best results, use consistently. Be sure to let dry before applying
              makeup. If using a makeup remover, be sure to wash off all residue prior to application. There is no added
              benefit to using more than once per day.
